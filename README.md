## 👋 Hi, I'm Anil Verma

### AVP – Information Management | Cloud Data Quality Enthusiast | GCP & dbt Builder in Progress

---

I'm on a mission to **bridge the gap between data governance and engineering** by building practical, cloud-native data quality solutions that actually solve business problems.

After 8+ years in data quality and governance across BFSI, I realized most teams still rely on Excel and manual processes to manage critical data assets.

So now, I’m using:
- **SQL + dbt** to model scalable data quality rules
- **BigQuery + GCP tools** to automate profiling and metadata
- And a **product mindset** to build solutions that could one day run as a service or open platform

---

## 🚧 Current Build: Cloud-Native Data Quality Framework (GCP + dbt)

> A modular, extensible rule-based framework to replace spreadsheet audits with SQL-driven, metadata-aware pipelines.

🧰 Tech Stack: `dbt-core` • `BigQuery` • `Dataplex` • `Data Catalog` • `Looker Studio`  
📁 [See the project repo →](https://github.com/Anil-Verma)

## 📚 Learning & Building (Jul–Sep 2025)

✅ Mastering:
- BigQuery SQL for profiling
- dbt models and testing
- GitHub workflows
- GCP-native governance tools (Dataplex, Dataflow, Dataproc)

🧠 Avoiding unnecessary fluff (Kubernetes, frontend) to stay focused on what solves real data problems.

## 📈 Career Direction

I'm not just looking for a new job — I'm building toward:
- **Higher-paying, cloud-native roles** (Data Quality / Analytics Engineering / Metadata Platforms)
- **Productization of my solution**
- Collaborating with data teams or consultancies who want to pilot or extend these ideas
